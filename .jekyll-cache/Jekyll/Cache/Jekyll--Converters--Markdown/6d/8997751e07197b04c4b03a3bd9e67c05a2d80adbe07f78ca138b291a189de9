  <p>Hi! this is just a sample <strong>intro text</strong>. You would normally put your <a href="about/">full name</a> here and say something <em>smart</em> about yourself.</p>

  <p>This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you <a href="work/">do for a living</a> and maybe what you are <a href="projects/">interested in</a>. You might also be <a href="articles/">writing</a> about stuff.</p>

  <p>But after all this is your site and Iâ€™m just a <strong>placeholder text</strong> so what would i know about some <em>home page content</em>.</p>
