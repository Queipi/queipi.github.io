dear dr zdun

For the last two monthes, I have been reading some of the publications of your group, as well as reflecting on my own area of interest and how to best define it. 
I will expand a bit on this, in order to give you a better idea of what I'm aiming at and how I can best contribute to your group (and whether I'm indeed suited.)

During our conversation, you said I had interest in a variety of subjects across the field of Computer Science, but I believe I'm actually focusing on a very precise thema: the fundamentals of software design. 
It just appear to me that the same issues and  the same solutions occur in a lot of differents areas in our field, without having been adressed in a common framework, to my knowledge at least.
The underlying challenges in composing the architecture of an application, designing the functions in a module or organizing files and folders seem to me to be one and the same.

Now, of course, even if there is an underlying general theory, it should be studied and challenged in every of its particular application.
Let it be clear that my motivation is to provide guidance and conceptual tools to developpers and architects for the decisions they have to take every day.

Also, I do not claim to start from a blank state: my work and experience pushed me toward some ideas already.
I do believe that the fundamental problem is about the separation of concerns, both vertically (levels of abstraction) and horizontally (segregation of responsabilities.)
I usually refer to it as a trichotomy, since the separation of two previously intricated concerns is not possible without also defining the way they are coupled.
Hence the atomic division is necessarily three-part.
